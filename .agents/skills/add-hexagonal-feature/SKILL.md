# Skill: Add a Hexagonal Feature

Use this skill to implement a new feature, use case, or business capability in
a Python hexagonal project.

This skill focuses on the application and domain changes needed to add a use
case cleanly. It owns feature-level orchestration across domain,
application, and tests. When the change requires a new port or adapter, use
the specialized skill for that procedure instead of duplicating it here.

## Prerequisites

- The project already has the standard hexagonal `src/` layout.
- The feature is clear enough that you understand its inputs, outputs, and core
  business rules.

## Steps

### 1. Name the use case

Choose a clear verb-noun name for the use case, for example `PlaceOrder`,
`RegisterUser`, or `SendNotification`. Use that name consistently for the
related files and classes.

### 2. Model the domain if needed

Create or update files under `src/<app_name>/domain/`:

- **Entity** — an object with identity that changes over time.
- **Value object** — an immutable descriptor (e.g. `EmailAddress`, `Money`).
- **Domain event** — something that happened (e.g. `OrderPlaced`).

Rules:

- Domain objects must be pure Python with no framework imports or I/O.
- Use `@dataclass(frozen=True)` for value objects.
- Raise domain-specific exceptions, not HTTP or database errors.

```python
# src/<app_name>/domain/<entity>.py
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class <Entity>:
    id: str
```

### 3. Define or confirm the required ports

Identify the application boundaries the feature needs:

- an input port when an external caller invokes a new use case
- one or more output ports when the application needs infrastructure
  dependencies such as repositories, publishers, or gateways

If a required port does not exist yet, use `python-add-port` for the detailed
procedure. In this skill, keep the focus on deciding which boundaries the
feature needs and making sure the application service depends only on those
port contracts.

If the use case needs command, query, or result objects, create or update them
under `src/<app_name>/application/dtos/`.

### 4. Implement the application service

Create the use case implementation under `src/<app_name>/application/use_cases/`:

```python
class <UseCaseName>:
    def __init__(self, repository: <EntityRepositoryPort>) -> None:
        self._repository = repository

    def execute(self, command: <Command>) -> <Result>:
        ...
```

Rules:

- The application service depends only on domain objects and port interfaces.
- Keep command, query, and result DTOs under `application/dtos/` and use them at
  the application boundary when dedicated boundary types help clarify the use case.
- It must not import from `adapters/`.
- It must not perform I/O directly, including `open()`, HTTP calls, or database
  access.
- If the feature needs a new adapter implementation for an existing or new
  port, use `python-add-adapter` for that procedure.

### 5. Write unit tests

Create application-service tests under `tests/unit/application/`. If the change
adds or changes domain invariants, add or update domain tests under
`tests/unit/domain/` as well.

```python
class FakeRepository:
    def __init__(self) -> None:
        self.saved: list[object] = []

    def save(self, entity: object) -> None:
        self.saved.append(entity)

def test_<use_case_name>_happy_path() -> None:
    repo = FakeRepository()
    use_case = <UseCaseName>(repository=repo)
    use_case.execute(<Command>(...))
    assert len(repo.saved) == 1
```

TDD is encouraged when it fits the change. Writing tests before the
implementation is fine and often preferable.

- Prefer a hand-written fake for outbound ports. Use `MagicMock` only when a
  narrow interaction assertion is clearer than asserting on fake state.
- Cover the happy path and at least one failure or edge case.

## Dependency direction reminder

The canonical dependency rules are in `03-architecture-guardrails.md`. This diagram is a quick reference only.

```
adapters/input   →  application  →  domain
adapters/output  →  (implements application/ports)
```

Never let an arrow point in the opposite direction.
