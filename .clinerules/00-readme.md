# How this ruleset is structured

## Structure and ordering
- Files in `.clinerules/` are **active** rules.
- This ruleset is an **opinionated reusable profile** for Python projects using hexagonal architecture with Cline.
- Rule files use sortable prefixes (for example `00-`, `01-`, `02-`, `03-`) to keep the reading order stable.
- Each file should focus on a single theme (core standards, architecture, testing, etc.).

## Opinionated defaults
- This ruleset is intentionally opinionated.
- Use `uv` for dependency management, environment management, and command execution.
- Use `ruff` for formatting, linting, and import cleanup.
- Use `mypy` for type checking.
- Use `pytest` for automated tests.
- Use `pytest-asyncio` for async tests when async code is present.
- Use Google-style docstrings.
- Use `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock` as the canonical tooling and dependency configuration surface.
- Prefer dependency groups for development-only tooling and test dependencies.
- Use `application/dtos/` as the default home for command, query, and result DTOs in the application layer.
- Follow hexagonal architecture with inward-pointing dependencies and explicit ports/adapters boundaries.

## Rule precedence and conflict resolution
- Treat rules marked as **hard constraints** or **non-negotiable** as highest priority within `.clinerules/`.
- Explicit overrides beat implicit interpretation. When a later module intentionally sharpens an earlier rule, it should say so directly.
- More specific rules take precedence over broader rules on the same topic.
- **Must** statements take precedence over **Should** statements.
- If two rules with the same strength and scope still conflict, use file order only as a **last-resort tiebreaker**, then update the ruleset to make precedence explicit.
- Any intentional deviation must be documented in ADR/PR notes.

## Reusable-asset portability
- Keep this ruleset copyable into another repository without assuming a specific local folder workflow beyond `.clinerules/` itself.
- Do not require repository-specific maintenance conventions such as sibling "bank," "disabled," or archive folders inside reusable rule content.
- If a host repository wants local enable/disable mechanics, document them in repo-specific maintainer docs rather than in the reusable rules themselves.

## Adding or updating rules
- Prefer **small, focused** rule files rather than large monoliths.
- Use **Must/Should** language for clarity and consistency.
- When adding a new module, update this README and keep the sortable prefix order obvious and stable.

## Rule authoring standards
- Keep each module focused on one primary topic with a clearly implied owner.
- Avoid restating requirements owned by another module unless the later module is adding stricter or more specific constraints.
- Prefer one requirement per bullet so review discussions can reference a single rule precisely.
- Use **Must** only for review-blocking requirements.
- Use **Should** for strong defaults that may allow justified exceptions.
- When step-by-step guidance already exists in a skill, keep the rule focused on policy and reference the skill by name.
- When a later module intentionally overrides or sharpens an earlier rule, make that override explicit.

## Ownership and specialization
- Earlier files should define broad policy and defaults for their topic.
- Later specialized files should define detailed mechanics for narrower subtopics.
- When a specialized file exists, earlier files should point to it instead of repeating detailed guidance.
- Use skills for reusable procedures instead of embedding that guidance in rule files.

## Related skills

Skills should own focused procedures. When one skill needs a neighboring task, reference the related skill by name and decision context instead of repeating the full procedure. Keep those references portable and optional unless a dependency is truly mandatory.

Prefer short inline references inside the relevant step. Add a dedicated `Related skills` section only when a skill has several common handoffs that would otherwise be hard to discover.

## Enforcement and automation matrix
Use this map to keep "Must" rules enforceable rather than merely advisory.

Interpret enforcement labels as follows:
- **Tool-enforced**: verified directly by automated tooling.
- **Review-enforced**: verified primarily in code review.
- **Process-enforced**: verified through operating discipline when tools cannot reliably enforce the rule.

| Rule area | Primary enforcement | Secondary enforcement |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Naming, formatting, imports | `uv run ruff check . --fix`, `uv run ruff format .`, `uv run ruff check .` | PR review |
| Type contracts and API drift | `uv run mypy .` | PR review |
| Behavior changes and regressions | `uv run pytest` | Targeted regression and contract tests |
| Architecture boundaries (hexagonal) | Review-enforced against `03-architecture-guardrails.md` | Optional import-lint/custom boundary scripts |
| Module/file structure conventions | Review-enforced against `06-module-structure.md` | Optional project audit script |
| Docs/ADR/changelog updates | Review-enforced via PR checklist | Release checklist |
| Logging conventions | Review-enforced against `12-logging-conventions.md` | Runtime log sampling |
| Command execution safety | Process-enforced (no `python - <<'PY'` patterns; git `--no-pager`/non-interactive) | PR review |

## Rules-to-enforcement alignment
- Hard constraints should be backed by tool enforcement where practical; otherwise, mark them as review-enforced or process-enforced.
- If automation cannot fully enforce a rule, write the rule so a reviewer can still evaluate compliance consistently.
- Keep rule text, examples, and tooling configuration aligned. When they differ intentionally, document the reason in the relevant rule file or PR notes.

## Scope
These rules apply to Python projects using hexagonal architecture unless explicitly stated otherwise.

## Project-specific customization
For project-specific navigation and structure details:
1. Use the workflow in `workflows/update-repo-navigation.md` to generate a current map, or follow the same steps manually if the workflow file is not bundled.
2. Store project-specific documentation in `docs/` or the project root.
3. Keep `.clinerules/` generic and portable across projects.
