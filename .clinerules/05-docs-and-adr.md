# Documentation rules: README updates, ADRs, changelog notes, API docs

Use these rules to keep documentation consistent and architectural decisions traceable.
Use the `update-project-docs` skill when you need a practical checklist for
README, changelog-style notes, or related project-facing documentation updates.

## README updates
- **Must** update `README.md` when behavior, configuration, or usage changes.
- **Should** add short usage examples when new CLI flags or commands are introduced.
- **Must** document new environment variables and defaults.
- **Should** document supported Python version(s), the `uv` workflow (`uv sync`, `uv run ...`), and the local quality gate commands when they are project-relevant.
- In-code docstring and comment standards are covered in `11-documentation-standards.md`.

## ADRs (Architecture Decision Records)
- **Must** create an ADR when a decision materially affects architecture, dependencies, or boundaries.
- When an ADR is needed, use the `write-adr` skill for the creation process, numbering, naming, and template.
- Put architectural rationale in ADRs rather than module docstrings or inline comments.

## Changelog notes
- **Must** call out breaking changes explicitly.
- **Must** record release-facing changes in `CHANGELOG.md` when that file exists.
- **Should** include a concise changelog-style summary in PR notes when `CHANGELOG.md` is not maintained.

## API docs rules
- **Should** document public ports, CLI interfaces, and plugin extension points.
- **Must** keep DTO field meanings aligned with domain terminology.
- **Should** document caller-visible error semantics, idempotency and retry expectations, and pagination or streaming behavior for external interfaces when relevant.
